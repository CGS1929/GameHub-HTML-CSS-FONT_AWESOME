# GameHub 🎮

A simple, responsive landing site showcasing upcoming, new and recommended games — built with HTML, CSS and Font Awesome icons.

## 🧩 About The Project

GameHub is a static website that displays a curated list of games under three categories — “Upcoming”, “New”, and “Best”.  
Each game card shows an image (or poster), with buttons like “Buy Now / Book Now / View Details” and “Play Trailer” with links.  
It’s a showcase project intended to practice layout design, responsiveness, and basic front-end skills.

I built this to sharpen my HTML/CSS skills, and to demonstrate how to use Font Awesome icons, responsive design, and simple navigation to create a visually appealing showcase.
